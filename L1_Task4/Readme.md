This project focuses on developing a sentiment analysis model to classify text data as positive, negative, or neutral. The objective is to analyze public opinion, customer feedback, and social media trends using data analytics techniques. Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods are used to preprocess and understand textual data. Machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes or Support Vector Machines are applied for sentiment classification. Feature engineering techniques are used to extract meaningful information from text. Data visualization helps in presenting sentiment distribution and analysis results clearly. The project improves understanding of text analytics and machine learning concepts. It also demonstrates how sentiment insights can support decision-making. The analysis helps identify user opinions and overall trends in textual data. This project enhances practical skills in NLP, data analysis, and visualization.
