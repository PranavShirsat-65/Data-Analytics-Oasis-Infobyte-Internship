This project focuses on data cleaning, which involves identifying and correcting inaccurate, incomplete, or inconsistent data within a dataset. Data cleaning is an essential step to ensure reliable and accurate analysis. The process includes handling missing values by removing or replacing them appropriately. Duplicate records are identified and removed to maintain data consistency. Data standardization is performed to ensure uniform formats and units across the dataset. Outlier detection helps identify unusual values that may affect analysis results. Maintaining data integrity throughout the process improves data quality. Clean data supports better analysis and decision-making. This project demonstrates practical data preprocessing techniques used in real-world analytics. It also helps develop essential skills required for data analysis and machine learning projects.
