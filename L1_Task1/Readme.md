Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on retail sales data focuses on analyzing sales information to identify patterns, trends, and useful business insights. The process begins with loading and cleaning the dataset to ensure data accuracy and consistency. Descriptive statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation are used to understand overall sales performance. Time series analysis helps in identifying sales trends and seasonal variations over time. Customer and product analysis provides insights into purchasing behavior and top-performing products. Visualization techniques like bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps are used to present findings clearly. The insights obtained help businesses make informed decisions related to marketing, inventory management, and sales strategies.
