💳 Fraud Detection — Data Analytics Project
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent activities within financial transactions using data analytics and machine learning techniques. The objective is to identify suspicious or unusual transaction patterns that differ from normal behavior. Fraud detection systems help organizations prevent financial losses and improve security by distinguishing between legitimate and fraudulent transactions. The project demonstrates how analytics and predictive models can be used to improve decision-making and risk management in financial systems.

🎯 Project Objectives

Load and clean the fraud detection dataset.

Identify patterns that indicate fraudulent behavior.

Apply machine learning models for fraud prediction.

Perform feature engineering to improve model accuracy.

Analyze transaction patterns using visualization.

Evaluate model performance for reliable detection.

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains financial transaction data with features such as:

Transaction amount

Transaction time

Customer or account details

Transaction type

Location or device information

Fraud label (target variable indicating fraud or non-fraud)

Each record represents a transaction used to classify whether it is legitimate or fraudulent.

🛠️ Technologies and Libraries Used
