📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a predictive model using Linear Regression to estimate house prices based on various property features. The aim is to understand how different factors such as area, number of rooms, and other attributes influence house prices. The analysis helps in developing a data-driven approach for price prediction and decision-making in the real estate domain.

The project involves data collection, cleaning, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and visualization to interpret prediction results effectively.

🎯 Project Objectives

Load and clean the housing dataset.

Explore and understand relationships between features and house prices.

Select relevant features for prediction.

Build a linear regression model for price estimation.

Evaluate model performance using statistical metrics.

Visualize actual vs predicted price relationships.

Interpret model results for practical insights.

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project contains housing-related information such as:

Area or size of the house

Number of bedrooms and bathrooms

Number of floors or stories

Parking availability

Location or region details

House price (target variable)

The dataset includes numerical features that help predict the final selling price of houses.

🔎 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Collection and Cleaning

Loaded dataset using Pandas.

Checked missing values and handled inconsistencies.

Removed duplicate records.

Ensured correct data types for analysis.

2️⃣ Data Exploration

Analyzed dataset structure and feature distributions.

Studied relationships between features and house prices.

Identified important variables affecting price.

3️⃣ Feature Selection

Selected relevant numerical features for prediction.

Removed unnecessary or less impactful features.

4️⃣ Model Training

Implemented Linear Regression using Scikit-learn.

Split dataset into training and testing sets.

Trained the model to learn relationships between features and price.

5️⃣ Model Evaluation

Evaluated model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Used R-squared (R²) score to measure prediction accuracy.

Compared predicted values with actual house prices.

6️⃣ Data Visualization

Visualizations used:

Scatter plots for feature vs price relationship

Actual vs predicted price comparison plots

Regression line visualization

📈 Key Insights

House area and number of rooms strongly influence price.

Larger houses generally have higher prices.

Some features have weaker impact on price prediction.

Linear regression effectively models price trends in structured datasets.

✅ Recommendations

Include additional features such as location or amenities for improved accuracy.

Use advanced regression models for complex datasets.

Regularly update datasets to maintain prediction reliability.
